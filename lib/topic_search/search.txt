Flutter uses a widget tree to build the UI. Every part of the UI is a widget, from the smallest element like buttons and text to larger structures like layouts.

Widgets are classified into two main categories : Stateless and Stateful.

The lifecycle of a stateful widget involves multiple stages : 

"""Initialization"""

createState(): Called when the framework is require to create a state object for the stateful widget.
initState(): Called once when the state object is created. This is where you initialize any state variables.

"""Configuration"""

didChangeDependencies(): Called when a dependency of the state object changes. This can happen when an inherited widget in the widget tree changes.
build(): Called whenever the widget needs to be rendered. This method can be called multiple times during the lifecycle of a stateful widget(such as when the user interact with the UI or when the state changes).

"""Updates"""

setState(): It notifies the framework that the state of the widget has changed, which triggers a rebuild of the widget(build() to be called again to update the UI).

"""Cleanup"""

deactivate(): Called when the state object is removed from the tree but might be reinserted before the current frame is finished.
dispose(): Called when the state object is permanently removed from the tree. This is where you dispose of resources (e.g., streams, animations).
